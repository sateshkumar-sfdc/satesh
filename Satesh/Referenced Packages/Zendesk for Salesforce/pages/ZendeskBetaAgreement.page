		<div class="slds-text-heading--large slds-text-align--center">BETA TESTING AGREEMENT</div>
		<div>Last Updated: February 16, 2017</div>
		<div class="slds-m-top--medium">This Beta Testing Agreement (“Agreement”) is made between the Zendesk and You. By accepting this Agreement or by using the Beta Tools (as defined below), You represent and acknowledge that You have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement. The Beta Tools made available to You pursuant to this Agreement may only be utilized and tested in association with a subscription to a Service (as that term is defined in the Master Subscription Agreement available at https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/master-subscription-agreement (“Master Subscription Agreement”)). By entering into this Agreement, You represent and warrant that You have the authority to bind the owner, and all Agents authorized under the account for the Service (the “Account”) to the Agreement and that the Master Subscription Agreement (including any terms related to Deployed Associated Services) shall not apply to the Beta Tools. If the Account is owned, controlled or operated by or on behalf of a company or another legal entity, You represent that You have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to this Agreement, in which case the terms “You” shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If You do not have such authority, or if You do not agree to the terms herein, You must not accept this Agreement. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Master Subscription Agreement. Further, You acknowledge and agree that (a) Zendesk’s obligations with regard to any Deployed Associated Service, including but not limited to Advanced Security, Regional Data Hosting or Priority Support shall not apply to the Beta Tools; (b) Zendesk’s obligations, representations and warranties contained in a Data Processing Agreement that may have been executed between You and Zendesk shall not apply to the Beta Tools; and (c) Zendesk obligations with respect to any certifications, including but not limited to, SOC 2, SSAE-16, PCI DSS, ISO 27001 or HIPAA shall not apply to the Beta Tools.</div>
		<div class="slds-text-title slds-m-top--medium">1. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT</div>
		<div class="slds-m-top--small">You are being invited by Zendesk to test and provide feedback relating to one or more software applications, application platform interfaces, services, features and/or functionalities not yet available for public distribution in connection with Your Account (“Beta Tools”). This Agreement covers all Beta Tools made available to You by Zendesk, including, without limitation, those Beta Tools which are specifically identified by Zendesk as being in “Beta” or any similar stage of development. Zendesk shall retain sole and absolute discretion as to what, if any, Beta Tools will be made available to You. You are not required to utilize or enable any Beta Tools, but if You elect to do so, Your use of and access to any such Beta Tools shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement. Zendesk may charge for use and access to the Beta Tools or may provide the Beta Tools for no charge. Zendesk reserves the right to start charging or revise fee amounts at any time, at its sole discretion, under this Agreement or after the Beta Tools are made widely available and incorporated into a Service. The Beta Tools may integrate with third party services. You hereby consent to the sharing of the information in the Beta Tools with these third party services and certify that You have consent from End-Users for the same.
		</div>

		</div>
		<div class="slds-m-top--small">2.2 You agree that You will not, without the express prior written consent of Zendesk, disclose any Confidential Information or any part thereof to any third party, except to the extent that such Confidential Information (a) is or becomes generally available to the public through any means other than as a result of any act or omission by You; (b) is rightfully received by You from a third party that is not subject to any obligation of confidentiality with respect thereto and without limitation as to its use; or (c) is independently developed by You without any reliance on any Confidential Information.
		</div>
		<div class="slds-m-top--small">2.3 At the termination of this Agreement or at any time by request of Zendesk, You will return all Confidential Information in Your possession to Zendesk. You also agree that You will not duplicate, translate, modify, copy, print, disassemble, decompile or otherwise tamper with the Beta Tools or any Confidential Information.
